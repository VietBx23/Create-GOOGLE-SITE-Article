## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) to convey sophistication and efficiency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D1C4E9) to highlight important actions and elements, and add visual interest.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clear, modern sans-serif, will be used throughout the app for titles and short paragraphs of body text. Playfair Display can be used as an alternative heading when a more bold effect is called for.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a library like Font Awesome to represent actions and categories. Active states use the primary color (#673AB7).
- The layout will follow a card-based design with rounded corners to provide a modern feel. Content will be clearly organized and easy to scan.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user actions (e.g., button presses, content loading). Loading states will use a smooth, circular progress indicator.
